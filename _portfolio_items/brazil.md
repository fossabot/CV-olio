I directed, and was heavily involved in the writing of the script of, the feature length film Brazil.

It is the second of my 'Trilogy of Imagination' films, following [Time Bandits](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081633/).

The film was nominated for two Academy Awards and [scores 98%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003033-brazil/) on the Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer.
