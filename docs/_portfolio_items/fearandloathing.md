I was hired late into the production process to direct and write this adaptation of Hunter S Thompson's best known work.

Working with Tony Grisoni, I developed the final script in just ten days. The final product was met with mixed critical reaction, but praised by Thompson. "Yeah, I liked it. It's not my show, but I appreciated it. Depp did a hell of a job."

Empire magazine featured the film in their "500 Greatest Movies of All Time" list.
