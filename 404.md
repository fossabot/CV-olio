# Sorry

# about this....

It looks like there is a problem with the URL you are looking for. Maybe you were looking for my {% for page in site.pages %}
    {% if page.layout == "standard" or page.layout == "portfolio" %}
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
    {% endif %}
    {% if forloop.first %} or {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
